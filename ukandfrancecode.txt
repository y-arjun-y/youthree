              U1: According to
              <a
                href="_blank"
                href="https://www.economy.com/united-kingdom/labor-force"
                >Source 1</a
              >, the labour force of the U.K. is 53,557,000 and the number of
              unemployed people is 1,637,000. Thus,
              \(\frac{1,637,000}{53,557,000} \times 100 = 3.1 \%\). The reason
              why there is a tilda sign is because I am unsure if this number is
              for 15+ weeks and over.
            </li>
            <li>
              U2: Unfourtunately, I was unable to find job losers or a statistic
              similar to that for the U.K.

                >Source 2</a
              >, during March-May 2021, 0.8% of all 16-64 year olds who were
              economically inactive said that they were discouraged in the
              Labour Force Survey. According to

              >, there were 8,806,000 economicaly inactive people during
              March-May 2021. Thus, \(\frac{8,806,000 + 70448 }{53,557,000 +
              70448 } \times 100 = 16.6 \%\). The reason why there is a tilda
              sign is because I am using economically inactive, not unemployed.
            </li>
            <li>
              U5: While I was able to find those who were marginally attached,
              the data is two years old. Thus, I am unable to provide an
              accurate mesaurement of the U5 rate for the U.K.
            </li>
            <li>
              U6: Due to the missing variable of those who are marginally
              attatched, I am unable to calculate the U6 rate.

          <h2>Calculations:</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              U1: According to
              <a
                href="_blank"
                href="https://www.economy.com/united-kingdom/labor-force"
                >Source 1</a
              >, the labour force of the U.K. is 53,557,000 and the number of
              unemployed people is 1,637,000. Thus,
              \(\frac{1,637,000}{53,557,000} \times 100 = 3.1 \%\). The reason
              why there is a tilda sign is because I am unsure if this number is
              for 15+ weeks and over.
            </li>
            <li>
              U2: Unfourtunately, I was unable to find job losers or a statistic
              similar to that for the U.K.
            </li>
            <li>U3: This is given by the Office of Labour Statistics.</li>
            <li>
              U4: According to
              <a
                target="_blank"
                href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peoplenotinwork/economicinactivity/timeseries/lf77/lms"
                >Source 2</a
              >, during March-May 2021, 0.8% of all 16-64 year olds who were
              economically inactive said that they were discouraged in the
              Labour Force Survey. According to
              <a
                href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peoplenotinwork/economicinactivity/timeseries/lf2m/lms"
                >Source 3</a
              >, there were 8,806,000 economicaly inactive people during
              March-May 2021. Thus, \(\frac{8,806,000 + 70448 }{53,557,000 +
              70448 } \times 100 = 16.6 \%\). The reason why there is a tilda
              sign is because I am using economically inactive, not unemployed.
            </li>
            <li>
              U5: While I was able to find those who were marginally attached,
              the data is two years old. Thus, I am unable to provide an
              accurate mesaurement of the U5 rate for the U.K.
            </li>
            <li>
              U6: Due to the missing variable of those who are marginally
              attatched, I am unable to calculate the U6 rate.
