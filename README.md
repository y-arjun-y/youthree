A U1-U6 viewer for countries. Note that this project is still a work in progress.

## What is U1-U6?
Unemployment comes in many different flavours, although, the one you're probably the most familiar with is the U3 unemployment. There are 6 levels of unemployment and I believe all deserved some attention in their own right.

Each rate is calculated a little bit differently. The higher you get in terms of level, the more people you count in the unemployment rate. If you want to learn more, here's a good <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/080415/true-unemployment-rate-u6-vs-u3.asp">article</a>.

I got inspired to start this project via a <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/07/02/1012771847/are-we-looking-at-the-wrong-jobs-numbers">podcast episode</a>. I hope you find my tool useful!
