# What is youthree?
youthree is a website dedicate to the unemployment rates (U1-U6 & LU1-LU4) of the United States of America and the United Kingdom.

## What is U1-U6?
In the U.S., the [Bureau of Labor Statistics](bls.gov) releases [alternative measures to unemployment](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t15.htm) from U1-U6. U3 is the one you're probably the most familiar as it is the one most commonly reported.

Each rate is calculated a little bit differently. If you want to learn more, here's a good [start](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/080415/true-unemployment-rate-u6-vs-u3.asp).

## What is LU1-LU4?
This is the labour underutilization rate given by the [International Labour Organisation](https://www.ilo.org/global/lang--en/index.htm). To find out more, see [this](https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---stat/documents/publication/wcms_644467.pdf).

## Inspiration
I got inspired to start this project via an [episode](https://www.npr.org/2021/07/02/1012771847/are-we-looking-at-the-wrong-jobs-numbers) of [The Indicator from Planet Money](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510325/the-indicator-from-planet-money).
